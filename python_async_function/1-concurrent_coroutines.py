'''Import wait_random from the previous
python file that youâ€™ve written and write an
async routine called wait_n that takes in 2 int arguments (in this order):
n and max_delay. You will spawn wait_random n
times with the specified max_delay.
wait_n should return the list of all the delays (float values).
The list of the delays should be in ascending order
without using sort() because of concurrency.'''
